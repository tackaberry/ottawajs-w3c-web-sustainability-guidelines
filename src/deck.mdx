# Web Sustainability

</Layout>

<Notes>

All jobs are climate jobs. 

I want to help you understand how your work as web developers and designers can have a positive impact on the environment. 

Im going to start off with a little bit of my journey, the context, and then we’ll get into the new web sustainability guidelines, and then finish off with some practical ways you can start.

<SlideTitle>My Journey</SlideTitle>

</Layout>


<Notes>

More recently I have been spending my time finding ways to put my effort in to helping the climate crisis. 

When I was working at a company in town called Rebel, I started to introduce sustainability and green concepts into our offering. If you're not familiar we were a web hosting company, amongst other things. 

We made a few decisions that would result in less carbon footprint. 

For example, when AWS launched in Montreal, we launched new locations and set the default to Canada. 

Montreal data centres are powered with green energy - so, this had an impact. 

This kicked off more green initiatives with the team.

For me, it inspired me to really evaluate how I can use my experience to work on climate.  


I dove right in, learned a tonne, I moved to work with a company building enivronment and civic focused apps, and yes, now at google. But along the way contributing more to how we can build to a more sustainable internet.  


I'm not an expert, but I'm going to share what I've learned so far.

# Context

</Layout>

<Notes>

First, let’s talk about the context.

</Notes>

---

<Layout color={GREEN} >

# The Climate Context

## <Icon name="looks_one" /> 1.5 ºC

</Layout>

<Notes>

The Paris agreement gave us the threshold to restrict global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change

So, we have to act now

</Notes>

<Layout color={RED} >

# The Climate Context

## <Icon name="looks_two" /> Carbon Footprint of ICT is Subtantial

</Layout>

<Notes>

The digital industry is responsible for between 2 and 5 % of global emissions. 

If the internet were a country it would be one of the top 5 polluters.

</Notes>

---


<Layout color={DARK_YELLOW} >

# The Climate Context

## <Icon name="looks_3" />Our Industry is Growing

</Layout>

<Notes>

And with massive growth in AI, IoT,  we'll see it grow to well over 10% within the next 10 years. 

Since 2010, the number of internet users has more than doubled. Global traffic has increased by 25 times. 

And what’s more, page size more than doubled in some cases. 

</Notes>

# Our Challenge

Our challenge is to divorce the growth of the usage of IT from its impact on the environment.

# W3C Web Sustainability Guidelines

</Layout>

<Notes>

Let's zoom back in a little bit and talk about some practical ways your work can have a positive impact on the environment.

Let's talk about the W3C Web Sustainability Guidelines.

</Notes>

# Who is the W3C?

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops standards and guidelines to help everyone build a web based on the principles of accessibility, internationalization, privacy and security.

</Layout>

<Notes>

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops standards and guidelines to help everyone build a web based on the principles of accessibility, internationalization, privacy and security.

You might know them as the organization that published Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. And the WCAG is referenced all over the world and is the standard for accessibility.  

</Notes>

---

<Layout>

### W3C launched Draft 1.0 of the Web Sustainability Guidelines in September 2023.

</Layout>

<Notes>

The Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG) 1.0 explains how to design and implement digital products and services that put people and the planet first. 

The guidelines are best practices based on measurable, evidence-based research; aimed at end-users, web workers, stakeholders, tool authors, educators, and policymakers.

</Notes>

---

<Layout light image={SlideAreas}>

<SlideTitle>Areas</SlideTitle>

</Layout>

<Notes>

The guidelines are holistic.

They focus on Power, e-Waste, Water and Carbon traps. 

Carbon traps are things like dark data, the carbon footprint of the supply chain - the supply chain of digital products being people, offices, advertizing, and everything else that isn't related to the power consumption or embedded carbon of the device itself. 


</Notes>

---

<Layout light image={SlideMarket} >

<SlideTitle>Audience</SlideTitle>

</Layout>

<Notes>


The guidelines were written with specific audiences in mind:


They’re very practically useful for people in the industry. These people are us, and our stakeholders and customers.

But our work will, in-turn raise awareness. Esp if we're building tools that are helping users gain efficiency and reduce their carbon footprint.

And we have to be mindful that standards will create basis for regulations. We saw it with WCAG and accessibility laws. As orgs build compliance to laws, we see it propagate into procurement policies.  

I think we’re going to see digtial and IT sustainability laws start to emnerge and they're going to be more strict and impactful.

# Stats

- 4 Categories - UX, Dev, Hosting, Business
- 94 Guidelines
- 232 Success Criteria
- many more resources and examples

</Layout>

<Layout light image={SlideComponents} >

<SlideTitle>Components</SlideTitle>

</Layout>

<Notes>

A guideline would read: Enable asynchronous processing and communication. 

And this guideline has 2 success criteria:  Use batch processing, and perhaps run when power consumption would be at lower carbon-intensity- running in a predictable pattern keeps utilization optimized, reduces thrashing- avoids user-impact of slow downs and outages; and the second criterion is protocol usage - using more efficient, secure privacy -aware routes 

Theres Impact, Effort, benefits. GRI reporting alignment.  Examples and resources.

# User Experience and Design

## Research and ideation, journey design, content and assets, and quality assurance.

- Research, consult, assess thoughtfully  and consider sustainability in early ideation
- Build automated value regression testing into the solution
- If you’re building apps or tools, there are a lot of guidelines for content and design considerations

</Layout>

<Notes>

Research and ideation, journey design, content and assets, and quality assurance.

If you’re building apps or tools, there are a lot of guidelines for content and design considerations


Example: Analyze The Performance Of The Visitor Journey

- ethically measure how efficient a visitor's experience is
- reduce the energy burden of loading unnecessary page
- only collect the data required to provide a streamlined and effective user-journey


Other examples:
- Use Recognized Design Patterns
- Avoid manipulative patterns

# Web Development

## Development sustainability, code optimization, and security.

- Mostly speaks to client-side technologies
- Building for security 
- Taking this further: Building performance and sustainability testing into CI/CD, and operationalizing performance measurement

</Layout>

<Notes>

Green software practices, code optimization, focussing mainly on client side technologies. 

Taking this further: Building performance and sustainability testing into CI/CD, and operationalizing performance measurement


Example: 3.17 Manage Dependencies Appropriately
- on the client side, larger javascript package size and large downloads can cause very high emissions in terms of CPU load due to the rendering process
- check for unused dependencies
- keep dependencies up to date - up to date software is more secure and more efficient

Other examples being: 
- Minify Your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Use Code-Splitting Within Projects
- Use Metadata Correctly
- Ensure Your Scripts Are Secure

# What does a journey look like?

</Layout>

<Notes>

Its going to seem daunting. It's a journey.  And you can start small.  And you can start today. 

</Notes>

<Layout color={DARK_RED}>

# 1. Measure and experiment

- Measure consumption of your software
- Lighthouse - Google Chrome Dev Tools
- Website Carbon - Measure the carbon footprint of your website
- Carbon sense - GCP's carbon footprint tool
- Cloud Carbon Footprint - Open source tool to measure carbon footprint of your cloud infrastructure
- Expand FinOps to include GreenOps

</Layout>

<Notes>

If you're just getting started, your first step will be an assessment. You can't improve what you don't measure.   There are a number of tools that can help you understand the carbon impact of your software.  

For this talk Im just going to hover around client side, but I have something for folks that want more on cloud sustainability.

# Lighthouse

- Google Chrome Dev Tools
- Measure performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO, and PWA


</Split>

</Layout>

<Notes>

On the client side...

Lighthouse is a tool built into Google Chrome Dev Tools that will give you a view of the performance of your website.  It will give you a score for performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO.  

This is a great tool to help you understand the impact of your website and to help you make decisions about how to optimize it.

# WebsiteCarbon.com

</Split>

</Layout>

<Notes>

WebsiteCarbon.com is a tool that will give you a view of the carbon footprint of your website.  

My tackaberry.dev site, as you saw on the lighthouse view in the last slide too, is set up well.  A SSG website, deployed to GCP Cloud Storage, with a CDN in front of it is a very efficient website.
