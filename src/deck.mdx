<Notes>

Maybe youve heard the term- all jobs are climate jobs. 

I want to help you understand how your work as web developers and designers can have a positive impact on the environment. 

Im going to start off with a little bit of my journey, the context, and then we’ll get into the new web sustainability guidelines, and then finish off with some practical ways you can start.

<SlideTitle>My Journey</SlideTitle>

</Layout>


<Notes>

When I was working at a company in town called Rebel, I was responsible for the technology behind hosting 100s of thousands of websites and more.  We experiemented with a few elements of sustainability - we made a few decisions that would result in less carbon footprint. For example, when AWS launched in Montreal, we launched this new location and set the default location to Canada. Montreal data centres are powered with green energy - so, this had an impact. This kick off more green initiatives with the team. For me, it inspired me to really evaluate how I can use my experience and focus to work on climate.  I dove right in, learned a tonne, I moved to work with a company building enivronment and civic focused apps, and yes, now at google. But along the way contributing more to how we can contribute to a more sustainable internet.  
I'm not an expert, but I'm going to share what I've learned so far.

# Context

</Layout>

<Notes>

First, let’s talk about the context.

</Notes>

---

<Layout color={GREEN} >

# The Climate Context

## <Icon name="looks_one" /> 1.5 ºC

</Layout>

<Notes>

The Paris agreement gave us the threshold to restrict global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change

</Notes>

<Layout color={RED} >

# The Climate Context

## <Icon name="looks_2" /> Carbon Footprint of ICT

</Layout>

<Notes>

The digital industry is responsible for between 2 and 5 % of global emissions.  And with massive growth in AI, IoT,  we'll see it grow to well over 10% within the next 10 years. 

If the internet were a country it would be one of the top 5 polluters.

</Notes>

---


<Layout color={DARK_YELLOW} >

# The Climate Context

## <Icon name="looks_3" /> Continued Growth 

</Layout>

<Notes>

Since 2010, the number of internet users has more than doubled. Global traffic has increased by 25 times. 

</Notes>

---


<Layout color={DARK_PINK} >

# The Climate Context

## <Icon name="looks_5" /> More Content

</Layout>

<Notes>

And what’s more, page size more than doubled in some cases. 

</Notes>

<Layout color={BLACK} image={BG1} >

# Our Story

</Layout>

<Notes>

My journey to understanding how I can be a positive force for our world has lead me here, working on how to make the internet and IT more sustainable.  But it isn’t my, or our, whole job - it’s a fundamental part - like security, or performance, or openess might be.

# W3C Web Sustainability Guidelines

</Layout>

<Notes>

Let's zoom back in a little bit and talk about some practical ways your work can have a positive impact on the environment.

Let's talk about the W3C Web Sustainability Guidelines.


</Notes>

<Layout>

# Who is the W3C?

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops standards and guidelines to help everyone build a web based on the principles of accessibility, internationalization, privacy and security.

</Layout>

<Notes>

I would hazard a guess most of you are at least aware of W3C or the world wide web consortium.  Not to diminish all their other work, but their Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are referenced all over the world.  

</Notes>

---

<Layout>

### W3C launched Draft 1.0 of the Web Sustainability Guidelines in September 2023.

</Layout>

<Notes>

The Web Sustainability Guidelines (WSG) 1.0 explains how to design and implement digital products and services that put people and the planet first. The guidelines are best practices based on measurable, evidence-based research; aimed at end-users, web workers, stakeholders, tool authors, educators, and policymakers.

</Notes>

---

<Layout light image={SlideAreas}>

<SlideTitle>Areas</SlideTitle>

</Layout>

<Notes>

The guidelines are great in a way that highlight a holistic view of concerns including more than just co2 - environmental impact is much more

- they address power on both server and client
e -waste - again both server and client
Water, as it pertains to cooling, is an important concern
Digital and digital transformation as a way to eliminate need for Paper and printing
And also carbon traps - like you and me - and all the other factors that go in to producing digital products


</Notes>

---

<Layout light image={SlideMarket} >

<SlideTitle>Audience</SlideTitle>

</Layout>

<Notes>


The guidelines were written with specific audiences in mind:


They’re very practically useful for people in the industry. These people are us, and our customers.

But our work and our customers work, will, in-turn raise awareness. 

But we have to be mindful that standards will create basis for regulations. We saw it with WCAG and accessibility laws. As orgs build compliance to laws, we see it propagate into procurement policies.  Unlike accessibility, which ended up really having no teeth outside govt, I think we’re going to see sustainability-laws be a lot more stringent and impactful on the private sector. We know already sustainability is extremely important to our customers - perhaps lead in this case by private sector - they’re all going to get hit with sustainability laws.  Manufacturing, CPG, shipping laws all aside - we’re already seeing digital and IT sustainability laws emerge.

# Four categories

- **User experience design**: Research and ideation, journey design, content and assets, and quality assurance.
- **Web development**: Development sustainability, code optimization, coherence, and security.
- **Hosting, Infrastructure, and Systems**: Environment commissioning, minimizing environment and data, and minimizing human disruption.
- **Business Strategy and Product Management**: Reporting, disclosure, strategy, and policies from both an organizational and website and product level.

</Layout>

<Notes>

Let’s have a closer look at the guidelines. 

They’re broken down into 4 categories:
User experience design
WEb development
Hosting, Infrastructure, and Systems
Business Strategy and Product Management

I’ll go a little deeper into each one in just a minute.

# Stats

- 94 Guidelines
- 232 Success Criteria
- many more resources and examples

</Layout>

---

<Layout light image={SlideComponents} >

<SlideTitle>Components</SlideTitle>

</Layout>

<Notes>

A guideline would read: Enable asynchronous processing and communication. 

And this guideline has 2 success criteria:  Use batch processing, and perhaps run when power consumption would be at lower carbon-intensity- running in a predictable pattern keeps utilization optimized, reduces thrashing- avoids user-impact of slow downs and outages; and the second criterion is protocol usage - using more efficient, secure privacy -aware routes 

Theres Impact, Effort, benefits. GRI reporting alignment.  Examples and resources.

# User Experience and Design

## Research and ideation, journey design, content and assets, and quality assurance.

- Research, consult, assess thoughtfully  and consider sustainability in early ideation
- Build automated value regression testing into the solution
- If you’re building apps or tools, there are a lot of guidelines for content and design considerations

</Layout>

<Notes>

Example: 2.26 Analyze The Performance Of The Visitor Journey
…ethically measure how efficient a visitor's experience is, … and reduce the energy burden of loading unnecessary page … only collect the data required to provide a streamlined and effective user-journey

</Notes>

---

<Layout color={DARK_GREEN}>

# Web Development

## Development sustainability, code optimization, coherence, and security.

- Mostly speaks to client-side technologies, empowering customers to build and test with technologies like Lighthouse would be valuable
- Building performance and sustainability testing into CI/CD, and operationalizing performance measurement
- Building for security 

</Layout>

<Notes>

Example: 3.17 Manage Dependencies Appropriately
…JavaScript … can cause very high emissions in terms of CPU load due to the rendering process…  check for unused dependencies,  keep dependencies up to date

<Layout color={DARK_YELLOW}>

# Hosting, Infrastructure, and Systems

## Environment commissioning, minimizing environment and data, and minimizing human disruption.

- Rightsizing, automation, batch processing
- Sustainable data practices, only keeping what’s needed
- Minimize transfer, use edge computing
- Async processing and computing
- Being carbon aware

</Layout>

<Notes>

Example: 4.5 Limit Usage Of Additional Environments
Decommission or switch off additional environments, such as testing, staging

</Notes>

---

<Layout color={DARK_RED}>

# Business Strategy and Product Management

## Reporting, disclosure, strategy, and policies from both an organizational and website and product level.

- Speaks to the business of building and operating a digital product
- Setting org-level sustainability goals
- Implementing sustainability onboarding training or guidelines
- Use open-source software

</Layout>

<Notes>

Example: Set Sustainability Goals

Example: 5.5 Estimate A Product Or Service's Environmental Impact
Conduct a full life-cycle Analysis (LCA) based on the functional unit (ex. per workload, per API call, per user)
Software Carbon Intensity considers power consumed (server and client) plus embedded carbon

# Using the Guidelines

- Resources and links in the repo
- Quick reference

</Layout>

<Notes>

The guidelines are constructed in way that makes it fairly easy to adopt and use.  There are a number of resources and links in the repo. 

Theres a quick reference guide that works like a checklist.

# 1. Measure and experiment

- Measure consumption of your software
- Lighthouse - Google Chrome Dev Tools
- Website Carbon - Measure the carbon footprint of your website
- Carbon sense - GCP's carbon footprint tool
- Cloud Carbon Footprint - Open source tool to measure carbon footprint of your cloud infrastructure
- Expand FinOps to include GreenOps

</Layout>

<Notes>

If you're just getting started, your first step will be an assessment. You can't improve what you don't measure.   There are a number of tools that can help you understand the carbon impact of your software.  

You might first start to look at CPU, memory, storage usage. Then you will want to take a step further to understand power consumption.

Your cloud providers will have the rudiments of usage reporting and you will have already integrated this into your FinOps dashboard. You can take this a step further and integrate carbon reporting into your FinOps dashboard.  This is called GreenOps.  

GCP has a simple tool called Carbon Sense that will give you a rough estimate of the carbon footprint of your GCP projects.  It's a great place to start. AWS carbon footprint tool is fairly basic too.

# Lighthouse

- Google Chrome Dev Tools
- Measure performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO, and PWA


</Split>

</Layout>

<Notes>

On the client side...

Lighthouse is a tool built into Google Chrome Dev Tools that will give you a view of the performance of your website.  It will give you a score for performance, accessibility, best practices, SEO.  This is a great tool to help you understand the impact of your website and to help you make decisions about how to optimize it.

# WebsiteCarbon.com

</Split>

</Layout>

<Notes>

WebsiteCarbon.com is a tool that will give you a view of the carbon footprint of your website.  

My tackaberry.dev site, as you saw on the lighthouse view in the last slide too, is set up well.  A SSG website, deployed to GCP Cloud Storage, with a CDN in front of it is a very efficient website.

# Cloud Carbon Footprint

</Split>

</Layout>

<Notes>

Cloud Carbon Footprint is an open source tool that will give you a more detailed view of your cloud infrastructure.  It's a great place to start. It takes a bit of work to get it set up, but it's worth it. It works from Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) that are downloaded and transformed or you can integrate directly.  It will give you a detailed view of your cloud infrastructure and the carbon footprint of each component.  It will also give you a view of the carbon footprint of your cloud infrastructure over time.  This is a great tool to help you understand the impact of your cloud infrastructure and to help you make decisions about how to optimize it.
